# Assignment 3 - count-chars
Using the same program from Assignment 2, write a program that returns the number of lines and the number of characters in the file:
```bash
~> ./a.out count-chars.txt
1$
3$
~>
```
If more than one argument is passed, the program should return a new line:
```bash
~> ./a.out count-chars.txt second-arg
$
~>
```

## Bonus
- Instead of a.out, name your program the assignment name - ie 'count-lines'.
- After each number, add a description of what was found - ie 13 line(s) or 3 character(s).
