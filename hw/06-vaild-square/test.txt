goes into the main
checks the argc to see if its correct 
then points at the argv which is the function 
after the function is complete it will print a new line 
and return(0);

the function
the function starts by initializing the variables (assignment 
of an initial value for a data object or variable.)
then it goes to the file discrptor(fd)
That line is reading a file... The read function returns how many bytes it
read, and puts it into char count...
Since a char is 1 byte, if read returns 13 bytes, then that means it read 13 chars

you then open the file in Read only form 
you then use an if statment to exit the program if it is
not the correct file
then you use a while loop
buff_size is the number of bytes it will read at a time
buffer is the string 
fd is the file
