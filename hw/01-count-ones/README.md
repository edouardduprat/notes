# Assignment 1 - count-ones
Write a program that returns the number of 1's in a given file followed by a new line. Your program should be able to accept a file like so:
```bash
~> ./a.out count-ones.txt
13$
~>
```

If more than one argument is passed, the program should return a new line:
```bash
~> ./a.out count-ones.txt second-arg
$
~>
```

## Bonus
- Instead of a.out, name your program the assignment name - ie 'count-lines'.
- After each number, add a description of what was found - ie 13 line(s) or 3 character(s).
